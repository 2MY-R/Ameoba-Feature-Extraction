This project was only done with my supervisors' help, support, and advice. Futhermore, I was provided with a solid foundation of code to build off and collaborate with to support the whole research team; as Olga and Rebecca have previously written, much of the code I am presenting. I have used their code and advice as a stepping stone to add my contribution to the broader project.

## Abstract

**How can artificial intelligence accelerate our understanding of rare, critical biological events?** Due to their infrequent occurrence, rare biological events remain primarily uncharacterised, often pivotal in disease progression or immune response. To bridge this knowledge gap, we propose a machine learning-driven approach to systematically analysing vast microscopy datasets. By leveraging advanced computer vision techniques, we aim to identify and quantify these elusive biological phenomena with unprecedented efficiency.<br><br>
Our study focuses on developing a robust foundation for future artificial intelligence models by extracting essential morphological, temporal and spatial features from amoeba and yeast cells, serving as proxies for macrophages and pathogens. We employed Facebook's Detectron2 to segment and analyse phase-contrast microscopy footage, producing a rich and structured dataset for future analysis. This initial phase involved building upon and tuning a comprehensive feature extraction pipeline to capture the dynamic behaviour of cells.<br><br>
Through this research, we seek to establish a framework for understanding the underlying mechanisms of rare biological events. By uncovering the critical factors influencing these events, we anticipate aiding the development of novel therapeutic strategies and preventative measures. Ultimately, our goal is to harness the power of artificial intelligence to transform our ability to study and intervene in complex biological processes.
